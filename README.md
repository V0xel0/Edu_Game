# Edu_Game
 Example of minimal game created for teaching my students. This small projects is meant as a proof-example of how relatively small amount of code is needed to get a base game running from scratch.
# Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a general skeleton (with minimal abstraction) of How-To's of fundamental gamedevelopment concepts such as:
- time loop governing
- tile system
- 2D coordinates switching
- 2D collision detection
- Rendering of sprites, IMGUI and custom bitmap fonts
- Sprite atlas managment
- Game state tracking
- Input handling
- Level editing
# Design
It is a simplistic edu-game in which player goal is to learn multiplication table by picking numbers that yield a result shown at top.
Additionaly you can customise map by adding lava tiles which user has to avoid.
